# slowpoke

`slowpoke` takes as input an AST generated by `esprima` and injects instrumentation code into all `for`, `while` and `do` loops encountered therein. Any loop which does not terminate after a user-specified timeout will throw an error.

## Installation

Get it:

    $ npm install slowpoke

Require it:

    var slowpoke = require('slowpoke');

## API

### `slowpoke(ast, options)`

Modifies `ast` in-place such that all slow loops will throw an `Error`. `ast` must be an `esprima`-compatible AST structure.

Supported `options`:

  * `timeout`: number of milliseconds after which loop should abort. Default: `5000`.

## Limitations

`slowpoke` only catches slow `for`, `while` and `do` loops - it cannot detect unbounded recursion.

Because `slowpoke` uses `Error` throwing as its abort mechanism, code containing `try`/`catch` may not function as intended. Future work could modify `catch` blocks re-raise errors thrown by slow loops.
